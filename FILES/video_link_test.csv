If the feet and the trunk are cold, the baby is very cold maybe even quite sick and needs urgent warming and care. To check the temperature using a thermometer, shake it down. Read it to be sure it's below thirty five degrees centigrade. In very hot regions, the thermometer will read higher than a fever if you forget to shake it down. Place it deep under the arm and hold the baby's arm against it's body. Wait three minutes and read the number at the top of the line. Some thermometers will need to be rolled before you see the line. To use a digital thermometer, turn it on and place it deep under the arm. When it beeps, read the temperature in the little window. The normal temperature is between 36.5 to 37.5 centigrade. The baby is too warm if the temperature is above 37.5 and too cold if it is 36.5.

Examine the baby,https://rhlaiservice2india.blob.core.windows.net/makelle-university/Examine_the_Baby_CB/examine_the_baby_cb.m3u8,"The baby's exam is best done on the first day of life. The health worker carefully examines the baby's body systems for signs of health and normal function as well as for illness or birth defects. This video would demonstrate the exam in three parts - observation, vital signs and the head to toe exam. Ask the mother if shed had any problems during her pregnancy or birth. Ask what she has observed about the baby. Explain to her that you are going to examine the baby to be sure he is healthy. Tell the mother what you are looking for and give positive feedback as you come across normal findings. First wash your hands, then clean the thermometer and stethoscope with antiseptic. Keep the baby warm during the exam. In a warm room, under a lamp or in the mother's lap. Observe the baby, look at his color, his tongue and lips are pink. Inspect his skin. A bluish area on the trunk is normal. Check for jaundice by pressing the skin on the forehead or nose, look for a yellow discoloration best seen in natural light. Check for pallor, a sign of anemia by comparing whiteness on the baby's palm with your palm. The baby's arms and legs are flexed and moving showing that his muscle tone and activity are normal. Check the hands and feet for extra digits. If there is no bone inside, tying a tag will eventually allow it to fall off. Count the baby's breath for a full minute when she is calm. Breathing is normally irregular, the rate should be thirty to sixty breaths per minute. Here is an example of baby breathing too fast with chest indrawing. Nasal flaring can be seen in some babies with breathing problems. Count his heart rate for a full minute with a stethoscope, the rate should be between one hundred and one hundred sixty beats per minute. Now, examine the baby from head to toe. Check the fontanelles on the baby's head. The anterior is here and the posterior is back here. They are normally flat but they swell a little when the baby cries. It's normal to have an uneven shape of the head due to molding from the pressure from the birth canal. It usually goes away by two or three days after birth.

This would go away without treatment. If the pupils are white the baby will be need to be seen by an eye specialist. With a gloved hand, insert your finger tip into the baby's mouth to check his suckling. Ask the mother if the baby has breastfed and whether he sucked well. A baby born with a cleft lip and palette won't be able to suck and will need an alternative feeding method. Its normal for both girls and boys to have swollen breast at birth from the mother's hormones. Gently press his abdomen to feel for softness. A swollen belly can be a sign of obstruction or infection. Notice that the cord is tied well. Some baby's are born with an umbilical hernia, as abdominal muscles mature hernia usually goes away by itself. Turn him gently over and run your finger down the spine to check for openings or defects. This baby has a large spinal defect and will need surgery. The anus is checked by the passage of the first stool. If no stool is passed within twenty four hours, the baby may have a blockage and will need referral. This baby was born with a closed anus that will require surgery. Look at the genitals. In males, you look for the urethra to open at the end of the penis. Feel gently for the two testes in scrotal sac, sometimes they have not yet dropped into the sac. Females can have a white vaginal discharge and even a slight bloody discharge several days after birth. Reassure the mother that she has a perfectly healthy baby.
