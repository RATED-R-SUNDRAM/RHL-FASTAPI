It's important to note that estimates of blood loss can be inaccurate, often underestimating the actual amount. Monitoring is critical, as bleeding can occur slowly and may not be recognized until the woman is in shock.\n\nThere are two types of PPH: primary (within the first 24 hours) and secondary (between 24 hours and six weeks after birth). Management includes monitoring vital signs, administering oxytocin, and addressing any underlying causes, such as retained placental fragments or tears.\n\nWomen who experience PPH require careful follow-up and education on self-care and infection risks.\n\nSource: [VAGINAL BLEEDING AFTER CHILDBIRTH S-29].",

Severe pre-eclampsia involves higher blood pressure and additional danger signs.

The process involves feeding the baby every 2 to 4 hours, ensuring at least 8 feedings per day while the baby is awake. \n\nTo cup feed, the mother should:\n1. Wash her hands and pour a measured amount of milk into a small cup.\n2. Hold the baby in a semi-upright position, supporting the head and neck.\n3. Rest the cup lightly on the baby's lower lip and tip it so the milk reaches the rim.\n4. Allow the baby to take the milk at their own pace, watching for signs of fullness.\n\nFeedback and encouragement can help mothers gain confidence in this feeding method. \n\nSource: [Feed with cup]",

Malpresentation occurs when the fetus is not in the cephalic position, while malposition refers to the fetal head being in an abnormal position relative to the woman's pelvis. Additionally, a baby that is too large for the mother's pelvis can also hinder labor progression. Signs of obstructed labor, such as ballooning of the lower uterine segment or Bandl's ring, may indicate abnormal labor as well. \n\nSource: [Normal labour and childbirth]",

This position is comfortable and promotes skin-to-skin contact.\n\n2. **Cross-Cradle Hold**: The mother supports the baby's body with one arm while positioning the baby's head with her hand. This is helpful for new mothers.\n\n3. **Cradle Hold**: The baby is held in the mother's arm with his head below her elbow. This is a familiar position but offers less control over the baby's head.\n\n4. **Underarm Hold**: The baby is positioned under the mother's arm, providing good support and visibility for attachment.\n\n5. **Side-Lying Position**: The mother lies on her side with the baby facing her, which allows for rest and is useful after a cesarean delivery.\n\nWould you like to see a video for this topic?",

Severe PPH is characterized by blood loss of 1000 mL or more during the same timeframe. PPH can occur due to various reasons, including poor uterine tone (atony), tears, or retained tissue. It is crucial to monitor postpartum women closely for signs of excessive bleeding and to manage any complications promptly. Active management of the third stage of labor, including the use of oxytocin, can help reduce the incidence of PPH.\n\nSource: [VAGINAL BLEEDING AFTER CHILDBIRTH S-29].",

Wait for them to open their mouth wide, then bring them onto your breast, leading with their chin.\n\n3. **Check Attachment**: Ensure the baby's mouth is wide open, their chin touches your breast, and more areola is visible above their mouth than below.

Do not apply anything to the cord unless advised by health authorities (e.g., chlorhexidine).\n5. If the stump is soiled, wash it with clean water and dry it with a clean cloth.\n6. If bleeding occurs, tie the cord tightly with an extra tie.\n\nIt's also important to practice guiding mothers on these care steps.\n\nSource: [Provide_Cord_Care]\n\nWould you like to see a video for this topic?",

This position offers good control for first-time mothers.\n\n3. **Cradle Hold**: The baby is held in the mother's arm with his head below the elbow and facing the breast. This is a familiar position but offers less control over the baby's head.\n\n4. **Underarm Hold**: The baby is tucked under the mother's arm with support around the neck. This position is beneficial for mothers with larger breasts or after a cesarean birth.\n\n5. **Side-Lying Position**: The mother lies on her side with the baby facing her, which can be restful and convenient, especially after a cesarean delivery.\n\nSource: [Breastfeeding positions].",

Surgical options include salpingectomy (removal of the tube) or salpingostomy (removal of the pregnancy while conserving the tube).\n\nWould you like to return to the home screen?",

This can occur either when the fetus is immature or preterm (before 37 weeks) or when the fetus is mature (term). \n\nImmediate management includes confirming gestational age, documenting fluid loss, monitoring maternal and fetal vital signs, and performing abdominal palpation. If fetal heart rate abnormalities are present, it may indicate fetal distress. Accurate assessment of gestational age and confirmation of membrane rupture is crucial to avoid unnecessary treatments.\n\nFor diagnosis, the typical odor of amniotic fluid is key. Various tests can be performed to confirm rupture, but digital vaginal examinations should be avoided to prevent infection.\n\nSource: [Document on Prelabour Rupture of Membranes].",

It's important to note that estimates of blood loss can be significantly low due to various factors, such as blood mixing with amniotic fluid. \n\nMonitoring postpartum uterine tone, vaginal bleeding, pulse, and blood pressure is crucial for early identification and response to excessive bleeding. Active management during the third stage of labor, including the use of oxytocin, can help reduce the incidence of PPH.\n\nThere are two types of PPH: primary (within the first 24 hours) and secondary (between 24 hours and six weeks after childbirth). \n\nSource: [Vaginal Bleeding After Childbirth].",

It is important to monitor postpartum uterine tone, vaginal bleeding, pulse, and blood pressure closely to identify and respond to excessive bleeding promptly.

Tears can occur in the cervix, vagina, or perineum, contributing to bleeding. Retained tissue from the placenta can also prevent the uterus from contracting properly.\n\nMonitoring for signs of increased bleeding, such as a rapid pulse or low blood pressure, is crucial for early intervention.

Perform manual correction by grasping the inverted uterus and pushing it through the cervix towards the umbilicus. Support the uterus with the other hand. If the placenta is still attached, manually remove it after correction.\n5. If manual correction fails, consider hydrostatic correction or combined abdominal-vaginal correction under general anesthesia.\n6.

It involves teaching the mother to recognize her baby's feeding signals and ensuring proper positioning. Initially, the baby may only take small amounts of milk, but as they mature, they will learn to suckle effectively. \n\nCommon breastfeeding positions include the recline position, cross-cradle hold, cradle hold, underarm hold, and side-lying position. Each position has its benefits and helps improve attachment and comfort for both mother and baby.\n\nSupport during breastfeeding includes nipple stimulation, ensuring the baby is properly positioned, and evaluating the baby's effectiveness at breastfeeding. If the baby struggles, mothers should express milk regularly and maintain good nutrition.\n\nWould you like more information on this topic?
